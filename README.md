# Hello there üëãüèΩ

My name is Maria Gabriela Ayala, my interests lie at the intersection between data üìä, technology üíª, and public policy üèõÔ∏è! I am interested in building human-centered software and improving digital service delivery to improve people's lives and tackle complex social challenges.

üéì I hold an MSc in Computational Analysis & Public Policy ([MSCAPP](https://capp.uchicago.edu)) from the University of Chicago, a Master in Public Administration ([MPA](https://www.lse.ac.uk/school-of-public-policy)) from the London School of Economics and a BA in Economics, Chinese, and Italian from [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu).
